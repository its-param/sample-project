# Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I'm Paramjeet Singh â€“ currently pursuing my MBA in Information Systems Management at IBU Toronto.  
I'm passionate about data, analytics, and using technology to solve real business problems.

This is my first repository as I begin my GitHub journey.

Stay tuned for projects on Excel, Data Analytics, Business Analysis, and more!
